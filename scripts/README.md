## Usage

All scripts should be run from the `scripts` directory and will automatically connect to the database at `../data/vender.db`.

Make sure you have Bun installed and the database exists before running these scripts.

### Email Configuration

For the reminder email script, you need to set SMTP environment variables:

```bash
export SMTP_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
export SMTP_PORT="465"
export SMTP_USER="your@email.com"
export SMTP_PASS="your-password"
export SMTP_FROM="noreply@yourdomain.com"  # Optional
export SMTP_FROM_NAME="Vender Tickets"     # Optional
```

See [REMINDER_EMAILS.md](./REMINDER_EMAILS.md) for complete documentation.
